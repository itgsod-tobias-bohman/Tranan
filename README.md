Tranan
======
Tranan is a school project in Webdesign where we were supposed to make a website fit for a hotel that we would make up ourselves.
First we had to think of how we would want our hotel, then starting making mock ups for the website.
For more info about this, go to the projects wiki.

### Hotel Kurēn
Welcome to Hotel Kurēn, we are a small family based hostel kind of hotel.
We currently only have 4 rooms and only by phone booking.

If you are a climber/hiker or just a wildlife kind of person, this might be the place for you!
We are located up on a mountain in Kyoto, Japan. 
It can be dangerous to get up here but once you're up, you're in for a treat!
All food are produced up here and we have one of the best views in the world from every single window!
And if you want to meet pandas, we have a reservation for pandas right outside the hotel!

The hotel is run by two 78 year olds, they have lived in Japan since they were born and have deep knowledge in the mountains and meditation, they even host daily meditation sessions.
So if you're nearby and seek shelter for the night or week, call us on xxxxxxxxx.
